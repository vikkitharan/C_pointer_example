A simple program which explains the memory allocation, update and usage in different functions.

- test.sh script compiles the code and checks the memory leaks using valgrind.

- Makefile compiles the code with -g option for valgrind

- pointer.c
1. allocates memory in a function
  - Memory allocation function must have pointer of pointer argument.

2. updates the memory in another function

3. access the memory in third function


- memory update and access functions should have pointer argument
